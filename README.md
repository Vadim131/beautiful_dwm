I am using dwm-flexipatch (https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch) for this, but it is possibe to do it with just dwm. 
To make the same, first of all, make sure you patched it with XRDB_PATCH. Also you need pywal (https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal). After change your xrdb.c with xrdb from there, and edit path at the file to your path to wallpapers.
You may want to do the colorful console and firefox. For this look at pywal instruction and at pywalfox (https://github.com/Frewacom/pywalfox)
